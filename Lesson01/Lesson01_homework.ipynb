    "0. Can you come up out 3 sceneraies which use AI methods?\n",
    "Ans: Face recognition; Chat Robot; Spam automatic detect and removal\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do we use Github; Why do we use Jupyter and Pycharm;\n",
    "Ans: we can share code on Github, it helps control version and collaborate.\n",
    "     Jupyter can show result instantly, good for class teaching\n",
    "     Pycharm works well with larger project \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What's the Probability Model?\n",
    "Ans: It is based on Bayesian's probability algorithm, the event are not independent, we can use past data to create a pattern and predict future result. The larger the datebase,the more accurate the pattern is.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Probability Model?\n",
    "Ans: predict tomorrow's weather; Predict aftershocks that occurred after a major earthquake\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why do we use probability and what's the difficult points for programming based on parsing and pattern match?\n",
    "Ans: it can be more effective and we don't need to get deep down on the very details of the actual event.\n",
    "    the difficult lies in data clean and we need a very large datebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What's the Language Model;\n",
    "Ans: use probability to predict the order or occurance of a sentence or phrase\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Language Model?\n",
    "Ans: Speech Recognition; Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What's the 1-gram language model;\n",
    "Ans: each word is independant, we compute the word itself's probility. It is simple probability of\n",
    "a given word amongst all words.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What's the disadvantages and advantages of 1-gram language model;\n",
    "Ans:  the result is not ideal\n",
    "advantage: the math is relatively simple and don't need much computer resouce\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What't the 2-gram models;\n",
    "Ans: given two words, we can calculate the occurance of the orders, and by comparing the probility, we can decide which combination(order) is more likely occured in real life. \n",
